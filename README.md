## List Pagination and Filtering

---

Creating a page to display a list of students ten at a time, with arrows to go forward and backwards in the list, with a catch to prevent going below page 1 and over the last page.

_This will be done entirely in JavaScript via DOM manipulation. If the user has JavaScript turned off for their browser, the entire list will print._

For extra credit I'll be adding a search function while handling situation that display no results,as well as displaying a row of clickable page numbers at the bottom,

This will be done with Vanilla JavaScript and not use any extra libraries. It's going to be done the hard way to learn the whys before being able to do it the easy with using existing JavaScript libraries.
